## reverse-skill

- Source: <https://github.com/zhaoxuya520/reverse-skill>
- Reviewed commit: `914f74ad7d42d18d983d5842f8156440d9068399`
- License: MIT

- Adapted from `skills/config/routing.json`, stored as
  `skills/reverse-craft/references/upstream/reverse-skill-routing.json`; Reverse Craft adds action-first bilingual IOC
  enrichment grammar and moves explicit R44 intent ahead of R9 malware analysis for mixed enrichment requests.
- Adapted: the 43-route taxonomy, deterministic scoring, specialist playbook organization, and bilingual routing
  regression concept. The local CTI/OSINT workflow is reimplemented for Reverse Craft's case/evidence contract.
- Not included: GPL-3.0 CTF Sandbox Orchestrator sources, AGPL Pentest Swarm
  sources, automatic bootstrap behavior, and forced action prompts.
