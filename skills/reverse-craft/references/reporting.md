# Reporting and confidence

Lead with the outcome, then the shortest evidence chain that lets another analyst reproduce it.

## Required sections

1. Objective and scope
2. Outcome
3. Decisive evidence (IDs, hashes, offsets/functions/events)
4. Reproduction or verification
5. Findings and connected paths
6. Limitations, contradicted hypotheses, and unverified areas
7. Artifacts and environment

## Evidence language

- `OBSERVED`: directly present in a preserved artifact or live capture.
- `INFERRED`: follows from observed facts through a stated reasoning step.
- `HYPOTHESIZED`: plausible and useful to test, but not yet supported.
- `UNVERIFIED`: claimed by a source/tool or expected by design without current proof.

Do not label a result confirmed because a parser ran or a string exists. A static transform gate does not
prove live request acceptance; a mock exploit does not prove the target build. A valid case seal proves that
the current local files match the seal receipt and graph, not factual correctness, signer identity, or an
external immutable history.

## Reproducibility details

Record target hash/version, tool versions, exact entry command, inputs, expected decisive output, environment
differences, and reset/cleanup steps. Prefer small command snippets and evidence references over raw log dumps.
